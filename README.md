## About the project

The project consists of a chained filtering feature, which means that the API information is displayed by considering a filter system that is interconnected, and the main content card wrapped by [a slider](https://react-slick.neostack.com/docs/example/responsive/).

Flexbox techniques are being used to make the project responsive.
